# landmark


* A new approach, a max landmark-sliced kernel, is presented to compute Wasserstein distance. 
* The proposed method can be computed efficiently for the case of two samples, unlike max-sliced (kernel).
* Landmark method is computationally suitable for high-dimensional data.
* We showed our proposed method could detect shifts locally, where the baseline method MMD explains the data globally.
